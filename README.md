# chipset_reversing

A collection of reverse engineered chipsets for 86Box. Mostly simplistic glue logic chipsets produced around the 386 era.

These chipsets are nowhere near the quality of a documented chipset or function as intended. They're done mostly for leisure and learning.

Status of the chipsets
Chipset|Status
-|-
Micronics MIC 471(486)|For now it doesn't work at all. It's shadowing procedure requires more understanding.
Macronix MCIX 307(386/486)|Works fine with MR and AMI boards.
ALi Alladin(Pentium)|Works alright but it's still quite incomplete and requires more understanding. Good thing is the Alladin 3 datasheet exists, allowing us to see some of it's registers as they're not different that much.

__Potentially upcoming Chipsets__
- ALi M1419(386)
- PC Chips 286(286)
- Symphony SL82C362(386/486?)

__These chipset will NOT be included in any build of 86Box unless requested by the team and I have zero pleasure to port them on PCem or VARCem. Feel free to use them for any personal use you want as long as I am credited__
